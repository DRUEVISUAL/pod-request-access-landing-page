### What I learned

I refined my knowledge about responsive coding, this is the best one so far in terms of responsivity. I learned a little bit about dom element properties.

### Continued development

It was a long process to find the solution for disabling the default invalid input popup box when entering invalid email address. I still dont understand it completely. There is a long way ahead of me to learn javascript
